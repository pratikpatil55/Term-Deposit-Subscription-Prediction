# Term-Deposit-Subscription-Prediction
The "Term Deposit Subscription Prediction" project is a comprehensive exploration into 
the realm of predictive analytics, utilizing machine learning techniques to forecast the 
likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit.
A Term deposit is a deposit that a bank or a financial institution offers with a fixed rate 
(often better than just opening deposit account) in which your money will be returned 
back at a specific maturity time.
Term Deposits are one of the best investment options for people who are looking for a 
stable and safe return on their investments. In Term Deposits, the sum of money is kept 
for a fixed maturity and the depositor is not allowed to withdraw this sum till the end of 
the maturity period. That is why they are called as Term Deposits because they are kept 
up to a particular term.
The project is sub-divided following section. these are: 
1. Loading necessary libraries
2. Loading Dataset from csv file or from Table.
3. Summarization of Data to understand Dataset
4. Exploratory Data Analysis 
5. Feature Engineering
6. Splitting Dataset into Train-Test Set
7. Model Selection and Model Building
8. Model Evaluation
